PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0

Acceptance. In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

Copyright License. The licensor grants you a copyright license to do everything with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any noncommercial purpose. However, you may not copy, modify, distribute, or make any other use of the software for any commercial purpose. Those commercial purposes include but are not limited to running the software as a service, using the software to provide a service, or incorporating the software into a service you provide to others. Any rights not expressly granted to you by the licensor are reserved.

Patent License. The licensor grants you a patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the software, where such license applies only to the patent claims the licensor can license that are embodied in the software and only for any noncommercial purpose.

Disclaimers. Unless otherwise expressly included in this license or as required by law, the software comes as is, without any warranty, and the licensor will not be liable to you for damages of any kind related to the software or this license. If the disclaimer or limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to its terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all civil liability in connection with the software.

Termination. If you violate these terms, or any of them, you lose all rights granted by the licensor in this license.

Trademarks. This license does not grant you rights to use any licensor's name, logo, or trademarks.

Copyright Notice. You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of this license and the copyright notice above.

Notices. If you modify the software, you must include in the source files a clear description of the modifications and the date made. If you distribute the software, you must ensure recipients can see that your copy is modified.
